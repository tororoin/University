## Chapter 1.1 - An Introduction to Morphology
### What is Morphology?
-> Morphology is the study of the internal structure of words.

Words have a internal structure in two different senses
1. They are made up of sequences of sound / gesture i.e they have internal phonological structure (the word nuts has 4 sounds / phonological segments : n + uh + t + s)
2. Formal variations in the shapes of words correlate systematically with semantic changes (nuts, necks, etc share the 's' which shows multiplicity of entities from the same class and without which, it refers to a single entity. Eg. nuts vs nut)

Words like nuts are **morphologically complex** words. The word can be broken down into elements 'nut' and 's'. This is unlike words like 'blitz' and 'lapse'.
## Definition 1
#### Morphology is the study of systematic covariation in the form and meaning of words.

Morphological analysis typically consists if the identification is parts of the word, or more technically, constituents of words. Remember **morphologically complex words**.

#### Definition 2
Morphology is the study of the combination of morphemes to yield words
^ this definition is too simple to be correct most of the time.


## Chapter  1.2 -- Morphology in different languages

Morphology is not equally prominent in all (spoken) languages and one language may express something morphologically but another may use another word or left implicit. 
Eg. Nut/Nuts, Night/Nights in English. Yoruba uses a seperate word for expressing the same meaning like "okùnrin" (The man) and "àwon" (The men).

Linguists use the terms  <u>Analytic</u>  and <u>Synthetic</u> to describe the degree to which morphology is made use of in a language. 

->Languages like Yoruba, vietnamese and english, where morphology plays a relatively modest role are called **analytic**
--> When languages exhibit an extreme degree of analyticity i.e. they have almost no morphology, it is called **isolating**. Yoruba and Vietnamese are isolating, but not English

-> Languages where morphology plays an important role would be called **Synthetic**.
--> Languages that have an extraordinary amount of morphology (compound) are called **polysynthetic**

The distinction between analytic and polysynthetic languages is not a partition but a continuum, ranging from the most radically isolating to the most highly polysynthetic languages. Te position of a language on this continuum can be determined by computing its degree of synthesis i.e. the ratio of morphemes per word in a random text sample of the language.

The above list gives the degree of synthesis for a couple of languages.

## Chapter 1.3 -- The goals of morphological research

Morphological research aims to describe and explain morphological patterns of human language.
