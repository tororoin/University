> **What is Syntax?**
> 
> > Syntax means 'sentence construction', or how words group together to form sentences.
> 
> > Syntax is not grammar, as many people conflate the two. Grammar includes all the organising principles of a language; information of the sound system, word formation, language adjustment according to context. 
> 
> > Syntax deals with classification of words, their structure and order in phrases and sentences and the different constructions languages use.
> 
>>> Syntax helps us convey meaning and relationship between words by meaningfully putting words together, like who is doing the action and what the action is. 

>By the age of around 7, children have a fairly complete knowledge of grammar of their native language and only add words to their vocabulary.  Thing is, children cannot be taught to walk, they just decide to stand up one day and take their first steps, provided their muscles and brain circuitry connecting their muscles to their brain is sufficiently formed. Learning one's native language is just the same; it happens without outside intervention and the resulting knowledge is inaccessible to us.
>> One may argue that they were taught the grammar of their native language, by maybe their peers or parents but that is a misconception. All normally functioning developing children learn their native language without intervention. They learn it by listening to others talk. This gives the idea that humans are pre-programmed to pick up languages, as they are pre-programmed to walk upright.
>>> There may be aesthetic corrections by parents, as they would when you learn to walk and not slouch or scuff your shoes while doing so. 
>>>> **For a linguist, dialectical forms of a language dont equate to bad grammar**

### Various dialects of a language infact share the majority of the rules and diverge in very few areas.
Speakers of non-standard dialects are following a set of mental rules like anybody else and socially stigmatized forms of language are potentially just as **logical** as English.
>The extent of the differences are exaggerated as they arouse strong feelings. 
>> speakers of prestigious dialects feel only their variety of grammar is correct.

### Many of the unconsciously known rules of individual languages like English and Welsh are actually  ```UNIVERSAL```- common to all languages.
