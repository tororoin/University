we need
1. Truth
2. Evidence
3. Model
4. Parameter

In a coin flip experiment, 
1. Is the coin fair?
2. Make then flip it a couple of times
4. Probability of getting head

Data sparsity 
-> less data is bad and cannot give a good maximum likelyhood estimation

Relative frequencies - frequencies in our observation (statistics from the past)
Probability - long run frequency (true from past to future)
### Probabilities != relative frequencies

99% of nlp is discrete distribution

### Conditional Probabilities
![[Pasted image 20231031112958.png]]
Outcome of one random variable influences the probability distribution of the other

![[Pasted image 20231031113109.png]]

Conditional probabilities can be defined as joint probabilities

marginalisation - converting join probabilities ....
