->Morphological structure exists if a group of words shows partial form-meaning resemblances. 
->Consider the examples:
	1. read : read-s
	2. wash : wash-es
-> These words are easily segmented into individually meaningful parts, and are called **morphemes**. <sub>more to be discussed in chapters 3 and 4 as some approaches question the usefulness of the notion 'morpheme' </sub>
-> <u>Morphemes can be defined as the smallest meaningful constituents of a linguistic expression.</u>
-> Any word that cannot be segmented into several morphemes is **monomorphemic**.

## Chapter 2.1 - Lexemes and word-forms
### Lexemes
Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fww1u6eNwxc
-> In a sentence, the total number of words and total number of unique words may be different. Consider for example :
	The cat ate the it's food under the tree.
For the sake of convenience, let us consider for the moment that a word is whatever corresponds to a continuous sequence of letters seperated by blank space. Then,
	Total number of words in the sentence : 9
	Total number of unique words : 7
-> When a dictionary is made, not every sequence of letters is given its own entry and the user is expected to know that some words are concrete instantiations of the same word. E.g. <u>the words live, lives, lived, living are instantiations of the word live.</u>
-> When a word is used in some text or in speech, that occurance os the word is sometimes called a **word token**.
-> A **lexeme** is a word in an abstract sense.
--> Live is a verb lexeme and its core meaning is shared by forms such as live, lives, lived and living.
-> Lexemes are abstract entities that have no phonological form of their own

### Word-forms

->A word-form is a word in a concrete sense. It is a sequence of sounds that expresses the combination of a lexeme and a set of grammatical meanings or grammatical functions
-> Lexemes can be thought os as sets of word-forms, and every word-form belongs to one lexeme.  E.g. the word forms live, lives, lived and living all belong to lexeme live.
-> Word-forms belonging to the same lexeme express different gramatical function but the same core concept.
