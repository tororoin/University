>A morphological rule or pattern is said to be productive if it can be applied to new bases and new words can be formed with it.
>E.g :
>>1. Teach + er = teacher, write + er = writer
>>2. quiet + ly = quietly, soft + ly = softly

*Simply, productivity is a way to measure how creative and adaptable a language is when it comes to word formation.*

<u>Interesting things to ponder about in the haspelmath book page 114</u> 

## 6.1 - Speakers' knowledge of productivity

>>Morphological competence - User's / speaker's knowledge of words and rules of language.
>
>
>>Morphological performance - User's / speaker's actual use of the knowledge for communication

*One view that denies the relevance of productivity to the study of competence says that productivity is a diachronic phenomenon, i.e. concerned with the way in which it has evolved / changed through time. When a neologism is coined, and is accepted by other speakers and becomes a usual word, this means that the new word enters the language and the language changes*

>The set of bases to which a rule could apply in principle is called its **domain** 
>
>> Whenever the domains is less than an entire word class, we say that there are systematic **selectional restrictions** on the rule
>
>>> All morphological rules are equally productive but they are not equally restricted

>>>>Eg: 
>>>> -*ness* in English, like sweetness, is unrestricted
>>>> -*en* in blacken, redden, is heavily
