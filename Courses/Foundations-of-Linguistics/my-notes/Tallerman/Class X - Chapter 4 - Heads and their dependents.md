### 4.1.1 Heads

> **Heads** : 
> >  It is the most important word in the phrase because it bears crucial semantic information.
> 
> >  Eg : A brass [<sub>N</sub> statue], meaning a statue made of brass. So the head is statue 
> >  Other examples
> >![[Data/Pasted image 20231111075816.png]]
> 
> >  Word class of the head determines the word class of the phrase.
> 
> > It is possible to use just the  head instead of the whole phrase.
> > Eg. She likes red [<sub>N</sub> roses]. The whole phrase can be shortened to "She likes roses" 


### 4.1.2 Influence of heads on their dependents
Heads play an important role while determining the properties of dependents

> **Heads select dependents of a particular word class, which may be obligatory and are known as `COMPLEMENTS`**
> > A head noun can be modified by an adjective and not a verb. 
> > Eg : Very <sub> Adjective</sub>bright [<sub>N</sub> sunflowers] and not Very <sub> Adverb</sub>brightly [<sub>N</sub> sunflowers]
> 
> 	**Heads may determine properties of their dependents is by requiring the dependents to** `AGREE` **with various grammatical features of the head**
> >  `Give an example in German by asking Brisca`  
>
> **Certain heads require their noun phrase dependents to occur in a certain order. This one form of relationship is called `GOVERNMENT`**
> A head is said to govern the case of its dependent
> >	`give examples in English after talking to Brisca`

### 4.1.3 - Summary - Same as above
### 4.1.4 `Complements` and `Adjuncts`

>>Complements are obligatory
>
>> Phrase selected by head, and has a close relationship with the head.

Adjuncts

>
>> Provide additional information (appearance, location, etc)
>
>> Adjective phrases, Preposition phrases are adjuncts too.

### 4.1.5 Verbs and verb classes and their complements
Major sub-classes of verbs:
> >`TRANSITIVE` -  Take an NP complement Eg. Assassinate, rewrite, etc
> 
> >`INTRANSITIVE` -  Take no complement at all, but however, have an adjunct within the VP.
> 
> >`AMBITRANSITIVE` - Either transitive or intransitive Eg. Lee [left Kim] or Lee [left]
> 
> `DISTRANSITIVE` - Have two complements, either Np and a PP pr two NPs
> 
> >A number of verbs have the particular kind of transitive / intransitive alternation
> >> [<sub>subject</sub>The Sun]  [melted <sub>object</sub>*the ice*] *VS* [<sub>subject</sub>*The ice* melted].

### 4.1.6 Other heads and their complements
>> Prepositions have notable variety in their `COMPLEMENT STRUCTURE`, although less than verbs.
>
>> Adjectives ocassionally take an obligatory complement, but that is rare.
